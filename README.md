# KyraDock
A compact, all-in-one smart desktop hub. It features a AI assistant, charging station, touchscreen interface and a built-in mini server all packed into a sleek, custom 3D-printed enclosure.

i've always wished to have an AI assistant by my side. I even built 3â€“4 prototypes, but they never worked well since everything depended on my laptop. This time, it will be fully independent, lets see how far i can take this ;)))
